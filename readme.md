# Shopping List App

This is a user-friendly, interactive shopping list application developed with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to manage their shopping lists by adding new items with a specified quantity, marking items as bought, removing items by name, and clearing the entire list.

The app makes use of dynamic DOM updates and showcases practical JavaScript techniques for handling user interactions.

## Core Features

- **Add New Item with Quantity**: Users can enter the name of an item and specify its quantity. The item is then added to the shopping list.
- **Remove an Item by Name**: Users can remove an item from the list by typing the item's name.
- **View the Current List**: The list of items with their quantities is displayed on the webpage. Items are updated in real-time as changes occur.
- **Mark an Item as Bought**: Users can click on an item to mark it as bought, visually represented by a strikethrough effect and a color change.
- **Clear the List Completely**: The "Clear List" button allows users to remove all items from the list with a single click.

## Technologies Implemented

- **HTML**: Creates the page structure and layout of the shopping list.
- **CSS**: Enhances the page's visual design, including styling for buttons, list items, and purchased items.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the functionality of adding, removing, marking items as bought, and clearing the list. Handles user actions through event listeners and dynamic DOM updates.
